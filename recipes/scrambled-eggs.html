    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            4 large eggs
        </li>
        <li>
            1 pinch salt
        </li>
        <li>   
            4 teaspoons butter
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>
        Directions
    </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Whisk eggs with salt until completely combined and very foamy.
        </li>
        <li>
            Melt butter in a skillet over low heat until bubbling. Add whisked eggs; cook, stirring frequently for even, moist curds, until thickened and creamy, but still shiny, 2 to 3 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove scrambled eggs from the pan before they begin to look dry, as they will continue to thicken off the heat.
        </li>
    </ol>
